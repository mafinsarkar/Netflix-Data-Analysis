# Netflix-Data-Analysis
📌 Overview

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights and visualize key trends.
It demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis workflow — from importing and preprocessing data to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing the results using Python.

🧠 Objectives

Understand the dataset and identify key patterns

Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.)

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends using charts and graphs

Derive actionable insights from the findings


🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment


⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git
