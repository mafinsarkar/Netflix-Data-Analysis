# Netflix-Data-Analysis
📌 Overview

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights and visualize key trends.
It demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis workflow — from importing and preprocessing data to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizing the results using Python.

🧠 Objectives

Understand the dataset and identify key patterns

Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.)

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends using charts and graphs

Derive actionable insights from the findings

📈 Key Insights

Summary of what you found during the analysis.

Example:

The Action genre was the most released movie type from 2018–2021.

There is a positive correlation between popularity and budget.

Peak content release was observed in 2021.

📊 Visualizations

Some of the visual insights include:

Distribution of data attributes

Yearly release trends

Correlation heatmap

Top categories by count or rating

(Add image previews of charts if available)
